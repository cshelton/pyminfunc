# pyminfunc

Reimplementation of Mark Schmidt's minFunc in python.
(https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html)

*Note:* Do _not_ use the Matlab code for minFunc here.  It has been modified 
to allow for easy testing of equivalence between this python implementation and Mark Schmidt's original Matlab code.  If you want Schmidt's Matlab code, go to the above URL.
